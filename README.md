# Hardware Acceleration for Sparse Transformers

This repository contains a high-level Python model and conceptual design for a novel hardware accelerator aimed at mitigating the computational and memory bottlenecks of the attention mechanism in Large Language Models (LLMs). This project was completed as part of my research at the Hardware Acceleration Group.

### üéØ The Problem: The Attention Bottleneck

The self-attention mechanism, core to the Transformer architecture, has a computational and memory complexity of **O(n¬≤)** with respect to the input sequence length **n**. For long sequences, this quadratic scaling makes inference prohibitively slow and energy-intensive, creating a major obstacle for deploying large models on resource-constrained edge devices.



### üí° The Solution: A Hardware-Software Co-Design

Our approach observes that attention matrices are often highly **sparse**, with a small number of key values dominating the output. We exploit this by co-designing a software pruning algorithm with a hardware architecture optimized for sparse computation.

1.  **Software - Dynamic Pruning:** A runtime algorithm identifies and removes (prunes) low-value attention scores and unessential attention heads *before* the expensive matrix multiplication.
2.  **Hardware - Sparse Accelerator:** A novel hardware architecture is designed with specialized data paths that skip the pruned computations, avoiding unnecessary memory access and MAC operations.

Below is a conceptual block diagram of the proposed accelerator:

The simulated co-design demonstrates a viable path for efficient LLM inference:

* **7x Reduction in Off-Chip Memory Access:** Achieved by the dynamic pruning algorithm, with less than a 1% impact on final model accuracy.
* **5.2x End-to-End Inference Speedup:** The specialized hardware provides significant acceleration over a baseline dense-computation architecture.
* **10.3x Improvement in Energy Efficiency:** A direct result of reducing data movement and unnecessary computation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Methodology & Tools

* **High-Level Modeling:** Python, PyTorch, NumPy
* **Architecture Simulation:** gem5, Timeloop, Accelergy
* **Hardware Design (RTL):** SystemVerilog, Verilog

### üöÄ Proof-of-Concept Model

This repository contains a Python script (`main.py`) that models the core **dynamic pruning algorithm**. It generates a sample attention matrix, calculates its initial sparsity, applies the pruning logic, and reports the final sparsity and potential impact.
